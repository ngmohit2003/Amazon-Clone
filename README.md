"STATUS" - shows the status of our code.
:
UNTRACKE-  New files that git does'nt yet track.
MODIFIEd-  changed files or modified files w/o commit.
STAGED-    file is ready to be commited (afted ADD).
UNMODIFIED- unchanged.
...........................................................|

git status            for status(on branch main).
                      (changes not staged for commit) when a file is modified locally.
                      after modyfing any file there is a two-step process to commit our changes : 1.ADD  2.COMMIT.
git add "#link"       to add a modified file before commit (can be verified on status).
                      also, if too many files are to be added together then we can just type "git add ." (dot) and all files will get added together automtaically.
git commit
